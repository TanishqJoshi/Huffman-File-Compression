# Huffman-File-Compression

Overview
This project presents an implementation of Huffman coding, a well-established algorithm for lossless data compression. The project comprises several key components, each designed to manage different facets of the compression and decompression processes.

Compression: This project efficiently compresses files by encoding the data using variable-length Huffman codes based on character frequencies.
Decompression: It accurately reconstructs the original data from the compressed file using the stored Huffman tree.
File Handling: The project supports both text and binary files, ensuring versatility in compression tasks.

Algorithms: The Huffman coding algorithm is implemented to ensure optimal compression by assigning shorter codes to more frequent characters.
Performance: The implementation is designed to handle large files efficiently in terms of both memory usage and processing time.
